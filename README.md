# OMFE.exe
This is a file encryption and decryption tool. Unlike any other file encryption tool, this software retains the folder structure of the folder path you want to Encrypt/Decrypt. It uses the safest AES GCM encryption and provides you a GUI to easily operate.

## How to use the tool

Step 1. Download the OMFE.exe file and run it.
Step 2. Prepare a /decrypt folder in any path of your system. You need to places your files or folders into this /decrypt/ path.
Step 3. Click on "Choose Folder" in the GUI and choose the path-to/decrypt/. In the display area (white), a message will print telling how many files are present in the path-to/decrypt/. The number of files includes all the files in all sub-folders too.
Step 4. Type a strong password (16 characters is preferred) and press on "Encrypt" button. This will start the Encryption process and will also be indicated using a Progress bar in the bottom.
Step 5. All the encrypted files will now appear in the same root location/path of /decrypt, but inside the folder /encrypt. All files will have .enc extension.

If you wish to decrypt then operate of /encrypt folder by choosing the folder and follow the same process as above. You can find the decrypted files in /decrypt folder with .enc extension removed.
